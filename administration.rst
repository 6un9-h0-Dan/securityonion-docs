Administration
==============

:ref:`soc` includes an Administration page which shows current users:

.. image:: images/users.png
  :target: _images/users.png

The Role(s) column lists roles assigned to the user as defined in the :ref:`rbac` section.

The Status column will show a different icon depending on the status of the account. In the screenshot above, the first account is disabled, the second account is enabled and has :ref:`mfa` enabled, and the third account is enabled but does not have :ref:`mfa` enabled. Hovering over the icon in the Status column will show you these details as well.
