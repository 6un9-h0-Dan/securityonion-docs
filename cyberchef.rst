CyberChef
=========

From https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef :

    The Cyber Swiss Army Knife
    
    CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR or Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.

    The tool is designed to enable both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without having to deal with complex tools or algorithms.
    
    There are four main areas in CyberChef:

    1. The input box in the top right, where you can paste, type or drag the text or file you want to operate on.
    2. The output box in the bottom right, where the outcome of your processing will be displayed.
    3. The operations list on the far left, where you can find all the operations that CyberChef is capable of in categorised lists, or by searching.
    4. The recipe area in the middle, where you can drag the operations that you want to use and specify arguments and options.
