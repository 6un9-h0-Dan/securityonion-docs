.. tip::

  For most use cases, we recommend using our Security Onion ISO image as it's the quickest and easiest method.
  
.. warning::

   **ALWAYS verify the checksum of ANY downloaded ISO image!** Regardless of whether you're downloading our Security Onion ISO image or a standard CentOS or Ubuntu ISO image, you should ALWAYS verify the downloaded ISO image to ensure it hasn't been tampered with or corrupted during download.

  If you're going to create a bootable USB from one of the ISO images above, there are many ways to do that.  One popular choice that seems to work well for many folks is Balena Etcher which can be downloaded at https://www.balena.io/etcher/.
