By default, you will be viewing Grafana as an anonymous user. If you want to make changes to the default Grafana dashboards, you will need to log into Grafana with the following credentials:

| Username: admin
| Password: augusta

Configuration
-------------
Grafana configuration can be found in ``/opt/so/conf/grafana/etc/``. However, please keep in mind that most configuration is managed with :ref:`salt`, so if you manually make any modifications in ``/opt/so/conf/grafana/etc/``, they may be overwritten at the next salt update.
