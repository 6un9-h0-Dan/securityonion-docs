:ref:`soc` gives you access to our new Grid interface. This interface allows you to quickly check the status of all nodes in your grid. If you have purchased our official appliances, then the grid page will show pictures of the front and rear of the appliances, useful for walking through connectivity discussions with personnel in the data center.
