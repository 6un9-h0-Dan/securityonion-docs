Changing Hostname
=================

Setup generates certificates based on the hostname and we do not support changing the hostname after Setup.

If installing from our Security Onion ISO image, the installer will prompt you to set hostname.

If performing a network installation on top of CentOS 7 or Ubuntu, then you will need to make sure your hostname is set properly before running Setup.
