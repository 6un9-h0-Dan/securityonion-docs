Hunt
====

Hunt is similar to our :ref:`dashboards` interface. The main difference is that Hunt's default queries are more focused than the broad queries in :ref:`dashboards`.

Query Bar
---------
The easiest way to get started is to click the query drop down box and select one of the pre-defined queries. These pre-defined queries cover most of the major data types that you would expect to see in a Security Onion deployment: NIDS alerts from :ref:`suricata`, HIDS alerts from :ref:`wazuh`, protocol metadata logs from :ref:`zeek` or :ref:`suricata`, endpoint logs, and firewall logs. Each of the entries in the drop down list will show the actual query followed by a description of what that query does.
