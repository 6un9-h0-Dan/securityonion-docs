Snort
=====

Snort is a Network Intrusion Detection System (:ref:`nids`). It sniffs network traffic and generates IDS alerts.

Previous versions of Security Onion compiled Snort using PF_RING for flow-based load balancing. However, Security Onion 2.2 no longer includes PF_RING and thus no longer includes Snort. Once Snort 3.0 has been released including full support for AF_PACKET flow-based load balancing, we can consider adding Snort 3.0.
