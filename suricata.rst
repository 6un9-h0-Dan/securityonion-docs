Suricata
========

From https://suricata-ids.org:

    Suricata is a free and open source, mature, fast and robust network threat detection engine. Suricata inspects the network traffic using
    a powerful and extensive rules and signature language, and has powerful Lua scripting support for detection of complex threats.

Performance
-----------

Suricata uses :ref:`af-packet` to allow you to spin up multiple workers to handle more traffic.  

To change the number of Suricata workers:

-  Stop sensor processes:

   ::

      sudo so-suricata-stop

-  Edit ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls`` and change the ``suriprocs`` variable to the desired number of workers.

-  Start sensor processes:

   ::

      sudo so-suricata-start

For best performance, Suricata processes should be pinned to specific CPUs. In most cases, youâ€™ll want to pin sniffing processes to the same CPU that your sniffing NIC is bound to. You can use the affinity settings in ``suricata.yaml`` as shown in https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/suricata-yaml.html#threading.

Also see https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/performance/tuning-considerations.html.

Community ID
------------

We enable Suricata's native support for :ref:`community-id`.

Configuration
-------------

You can configure Suricata's ``suricata.yaml`` using :ref:`salt`. The defaults for this have been defined in https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/salt/suricata/defaults.yaml. Under ``suricata:config``, the pillar structure follows the same YAML structure of the ``suricata.yaml`` file. For some of the settings to modify here, we have simplified the pillar configuration by placing the option in the sensor pillar instead of the Suricata pillar. These options are: ``HOMENET``, ``default-packet-size``, and the CPU affinity settings for pinning the processes to CPU cores or how many processes to run.

If you would like to configure/manage IDS rules, please see the :ref:`rules` and :ref:`managing-alerts` sections.

Thresholding
------------

To enable thresholding for SIDS, reference the example pillar at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/pillar/thresholding/pillar.example. 

To view the acceptable syntax, view the file located at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/pillar/thresholding/pillar.usage. 

This pillar can be added to :ref:`salt` in either the global pillar file (``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/global.sls``) or minion pillar file (``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/<minionid>.sls``).
